## What is DocX?

DocX is a .NET library that allows developers to manipulate Word 2007/2010/2013 files, in an easy and intuitive manner. DocX is fast, lightweight and best of all it does not require Microsoft Word or Office to be installed.


## Install via Nuget
```
Install-Package DocX
```

## DocX Author

DocX is the free, open source version of [Xceed Words for .NET](https://xceed.com/xceed-words-for-net). Originally written by Cathal Coffey, and maintained by Przemyslaw Klys, it is now maintained by Xceed. 

Currently, the only difference between DocX and Xceed Words for .NET, is that Xceed Words for .NET can convert a Word document to PDF, and has professional technical support included in the subscription.
